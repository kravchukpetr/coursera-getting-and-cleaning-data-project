The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

The features are unlabeled and store at the x_test.txt and x_train.txt files.
Ativities labels store at activity_labels.txt
The activity labels are in the y_test.txt and y_train.txt files.
The test and train subjects are in the subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt files.

Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform necessary data processing.
Prerequisites for this script:
1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be downloaded.
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset".

`tidy.txt` - output file which contains requirment tidy dataset
